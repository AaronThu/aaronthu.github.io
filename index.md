## Who am I?
### Bio
I was born in Arnhem, the Netherlands in 1996. 

In 2017 I graduated as an Ecology & Wildlife Manager, but decided to continue studying, this time in Computer Science. 

Since 2018 I've been a Computer Science student at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem specialising in Software Development.
